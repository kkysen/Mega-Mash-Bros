Moves don't last after button release. Must keep key held down to continue movement
AI spazes out (cuz only hits key once?)
Added F-Tilt attack
Moves now have a counter, so holding down an attack key no longer spams hitboxes
After getting hit, players placed into a flying state. Also, they recieve hitstun, so they cannot move for the duration of the hitstun
After flying state wears off, placed into falling state. x-acceleration is negated.
