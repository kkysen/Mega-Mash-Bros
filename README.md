# Super Smash Bros Clone

### Description
Rather than in traditional fighting games, where players attempt to whittle down their opponent’s health gradually in a closed arena, our game attempts to take a different approach. Attacks dealt will increase the accumulated damage the opponent holds (otherwise known as percentage) with the ultimate goal of knocking the opponent out of bounds, of which will become easier when the opponent is at higher percentages.

We are trying to mimic the mechanics of the actual game: every attack having a different launch angle, knockback of enemies being determined on their their damage and the type of attack used.
